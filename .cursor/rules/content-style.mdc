# Content and Styling Best Practices

- Use YAML frontmatter in markdown files for metadata (e.g., name, title, contact info).
- Organize content into clear sections: Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Contact.
- Use proper headings (##, ###) and bullet points for clarity and readability.
- Write concise, impactful, and professional language throughout.
- Maintain consistent formatting and spacing.
- See [docs/index.md](mdc:docs/index.md) for the main structure and style example.
- Avoid unnecessary visual clutter and blog-like narrative unless required for a specific section.
