# Project Structure Guide

The main configuration file is [mkdocs.yml](mdc:mkdocs.yml), which defines the site structure, theme, and plugins.

Resume content is located in [docs/index.md](mdc:docs/index.md), structured into sections such as Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Each section should use proper headings and concise bullet points.

Custom styles are defined in [docs/css/style.css](mdc:docs/css/style.css) to ensure a clean, modern, and resume-appropriate appearance.

All content and configuration should prioritize clarity, professionalism, and mobile responsiveness. Avoid blog-like or portfolio-style layouts unless explicitly required.
