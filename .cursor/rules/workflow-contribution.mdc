# Workflow and Contribution Rules

- All changes must be made via pull requests (PRs).
- Each PR should address a single feature, fix, or improvement.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Reference related tasks from [task.md](mdc:task.md) in PR descriptions.
- Reviewers should check for:
  - Resume-focused design and content
  - Professional and technical language
  - Consistency with project structure and style
  - Accessibility and mobile responsiveness
- Approve PRs only if all criteria are met.
- Major content or configuration changes should be discussed in an issue before PR.
